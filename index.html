                <p>My name is Luis Rishi Puno. I graduated from George Washington University in 2015 majoring in Political Science and minoring in Philosophy. I worked in politics as an opposition researcher. I most notably worked for the Bernie Sanders Presidential Campaign in 2016 as a member of his research team. I specialized in vetting and background checks.I am currently attending the Columbia Engineering Coding Boot Camp to become a fullstack web developer. I am to specialize in either video game design or designing political databases</p>
                <p>But enough with that boring crap. There are two things I love in this world. It's food and watching a good anime. What can I say? I'm a simple man with simple needs. I am currently attending the Columbia Engineering Coding Boot Camp to become a fullstack web developer.</p>
